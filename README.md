Welcome to FindTask Bot!!!

This will be helpful if you want to:
 • upload tasks to GitHub
 • find particular task
 
Our bot reacts on 'задач' in the message. 
It is also possible to add a bot to a group chat: FindTask reads all messages and reacts if there is 'задач'.
FindTask requests the homework number and the task number. If there is no such task, you can try again or stop working with the bot.
 
To upload tasks to your GitHub, you should send our bot a message with a link to the tasks.

We hope you enjoy using our bot!
